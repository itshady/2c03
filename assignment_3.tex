\begin{problem}
Consider the sequence of values $S = [12, 44, 13, 88, 23, 94, 11, 39, 20, 16, 5]$.
\begin{questions}
\item Draw the binary search tree obtained by adding the values in $S$ in sequence.
\item Draw the red-black tree obtained by adding the values in $S$ in sequence.
\item Consider the hash-function $h(k) = (2k + 5) \bmod 11$ and a hash-table of $11$ table entries that uses hashing with separate chaining. Draw the hash-table obtained by adding the values in $S$ in sequence.
\item Consider the hash-function $h(k) = (3k + 2) \bmod 11$ and a hash-table of $11$ table entries that uses hashing with linear probing. Draw the hash-table obtained by adding the values in $S$ in sequence.

\begin{problem}
We say that a hash function $h : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ that maps values from a set $\mathcal{U}$ to integers in the range $[0\dots M)$ is \emph{$n$-perfect} if there exists at most $n$ distinct values $u_1, \dots, u_j \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $h(u_1) = \dots = h(u_j)$.
\begin{questions}
\item Consider the hash function $h(k) = (2k + 5) \bmod 11$. Is this hash function $2$-perfect for the inputs $0, \dots, 21$? Explain why or why not.

\textbf{Answer:}
This function is 2-perfect for the inputs 0,...,21 since after computation, there is only 2 values mapped to one spot in the hash table. In summary, since the function has 2k, as you loop through the values, the new value will most often be 2 more than the previous. This is until you hit 11 as it is mod 11, then it will start back at either 0 or 1 depending on if the previous value was 9 or 10. The following is the computation.\\

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c||} 
    \hline
    v & h(v)=(2v+5)mod 11 & v & h(v) & v & h(v) & v & h(v) \\ [0.5ex] 
    \hline\hline
    0 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 12 & 7 & 18 & 8\\ 
    1 & 7 & 7 & 8 & 13 & 9 & 19 & 10 \\
    2 & 9 & 8 & 10 & 14 & 0 & 20 & 1 \\
    3 & 0 & 9 & 1 & 15 & 2 & 21 & 3 \\
    4 & 2 & 10 & 3 & 16 & 4 &  & \\
    5 & 4 & 11 & 5 & 17 & 6 &  & \\ [1ex] 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Rearrange to see that there are only two values per mapping:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c||} 
    \hline
    h(v) & v & h(v) & v & h(v) & v & h(v) & v \\ [0.5ex] 
    \hline\hline
    0 & 3, 14 & 3 & 10, 21 & 6 & 6, 17 & 9 & 13, 2\\ 
    1 & 9, 20 & 4 & 5, 16 & 7 & 12, 1 & 10 & 8, 19 \\
    2 & 4, 15 & 5 & 11, 0 & 8 & 7, 18 &  &  \\ [1ex] 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\item Prove that a hash function $h : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ can only be $n$-perfect if $\abs{\mathcal{U}} \leq n \cdot M$.
\item Can a general purpose hash function be $n$-perfect for any $M$? Argue why or why not.

\begin{problem}
Consider non-empty binary search trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ such that all values in $T_1$ are smaller than the values in $T_2$. The \AName{SetUnion} operation takes binary search trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ and returns a binary search trees holding all values originally in $T_1$ and $T_2$ (destroying $T_1$ and $T_2$ in the process). 
\begin{questions}
\item Assume the binary search trees storing $T_1$ and $T_2$ have the same height $h$. Show how to implement the \AName{SetUnion} operation in $\OOG{h}$ such that the resulting tree has a height of at-most $h+1$.
\item Assume that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are red-black trees with the same black height $h$. Show how to implement a \AName{SetUnion} operation that returns a red-black tree in $\OOG{h}$.
\item Assume that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are red-black trees with black heights $h_1 > h_2$. Show how to implement a \AName{SetUnion} operation that returns a red-black tree in $\OOG{h_1}$.
\end{questions}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
Consider \emph{binary strings} (sequences of zeros and ones). 
\begin{questions}
\item Design a data structure \AName{BSSet} that can be used to represent \emph{sets of binary strings} such that any binary string $W$ of length $\abs{W} = N$ can be added or removed in $\OOG{N}$ and such that one can check whether $W$ is in the data structure in $\OOG{N}$. Sketch why your data structure  \AName{BSSet} supports the stated operations in $\OOG{N}$.
\item Let $W$ of length $\abs{W} = N$ be a binary string and let $S$ be a \AName{BSSet} set. Provide an algorithm that prints all strings $V \in S$ that start with the prefix $W$ (the first $\abs{W}$ characters of $S$ are equivalent to $W$). Your algorithm should have a worst-case complexity of $\OOG{N + k}$ in which $k$ is the number of characters printed to the output.
\item Professor X claims to have developed a data structure \AName{BSSetX} to which any binary string $W$ of length $\abs{W} = N$ can be added in $\OOG{N}$. Furthermore, Professor X claims that \AName{BSSetX}  provides \emph{ordered iteration}: one can iterate over all $M = \abs{S}$ strings in a set $S$, implemented via \AName{BSSetX}, in a lexicographical order in $\OOG{M + T}$ in which $T$ is the combined length of the $M$ strings. Professor X claims that this method of sorting binary strings proves that the worst-case lower bound for sorting $M$ binary strings is \emph{not} $\OOG{M \log_2(M)}$ comparisons. Argue why Professor X is wrong.

We note that strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ are \emph{lexicographical ordered}, denoted by $S_1 \prec S_2$, if $S_1$ comes before $S_2$ in an alphabetical sort (e.g., as used in a dictionary). Next, we formalize $S_1 \prec S_2$ for binary strings: we have $S_1 \prec S_2$ if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are equivalent up to the $0\leq i \leq \min(\abs{S_1}, \abs{S_2})$-th character ($S_1[0] = S_2[0]$,
\dots, $S_1[i-1] = S_2[i-1]$) and either $\abs{S_1} = i < \abs{S_2}$ or the $(i+1)$-th character of $S_1$ comes before the $(i+1)$-th character of $S_2$ (in which case $S_1[i] = 0$ and $S_2[i] = 1$). For example, $0 \prec 00$ and $00 \prec 01$, but not $100 \prec 10$.
